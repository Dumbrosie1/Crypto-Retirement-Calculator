# Crypto-Retirement-Calculator
Unfinished EthDenver Project

This is a Retirement Calculator focused on cryptocurrency. It is unfinished, with only Ethereum Wallet support. But it does demonstrate the usefulness of retirement calculators with a Monte-Carlo diagram to allow hodlers to understand the likelihood of them running out of money. I will likely continue working on this outside of the hackathon. This was made using the Parsiq API service.

Improvement To-Do's:

Add other crypto support

Add yield earning support (i.e. Uniswap)

Improve the UI

Create a PDF Report Output
